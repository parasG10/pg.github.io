# E-Commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard

A data exploration and visualization project focused on uncovering key insights from e-commerce sales data. This project showcases data cleaning, SQL querying, Excel modeling, and Tableau dashboarding — all tied together into a clean, interactive presentation.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project was built using a sample sales dataset (CSV) from Kaggle and dives into questions like:

- What are the best-performing categories and products?
- How do pricing and review scores influence sales?
- Are there any anomalies or hidden opportunities?

## 📊 Tools Used

- **SQL** – data extraction and filtering  
- **Excel** – data cleaning and pivot analysis  
- **Tableau** – interactive dashboards  
- **HTML/CSS** – web presentation

## 📈 Dashboards Included

1. **Category Overview**  
   A summary of revenue and sales across all product categories.

2. **Top 10 Products Summary**  
   Detailed view of the best-performing individual products with filters and visuals.

## 🔎 Key Insights

- Some low-rated products (like Product 937) still have high sales volume. Brand perception might be at risk.
- Categories like Electronics and Sports outperform others in both revenue and volume.
- A standout product (306 – a book) has top-tier sales, price, and reviews. Would love to know what book it is.
- Review scores don’t strongly correlate with sales. Something else is influencing buyer behavior.
- Books as a category depend heavily on one product. Adding more similar products could balance performance.
- Home & Kitchen is the weakest category, and most of its top products have bad reviews. Could be connected.
- Sports products are priced well and have solid reviews. This is a category worth expanding.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Manual cleaning gave me better understanding of messy datasets.
- SQL made it easier to manipulate and segment large datasets fast.
- Tableau helped turn raw numbers into something that actually tells a story.
- Visual storytelling makes technical insights much easier to share with non-technical people.
- Finding anomalies is often where the best insights are hiding.
